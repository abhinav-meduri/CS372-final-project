      "   Upon review of the patent application titled \"Real-time video recommendation system using sequence-aware user embedds\" (Application No.: XYZ123456), it is determined that this invention presents novel features not disclosed by prior art. Specifically, Patents 12288236 and 11055629 share general concepts of recommendation systems using embeddings but lack the real-time updating mechanism for user profiles based on both short-term and long-term viewing patterns as detailed in this application (App). Furthermore, Patents 11636394 and 11611521 do not incorporate sequence awareness into embeddings or the real-time update of user preferences.\n",
